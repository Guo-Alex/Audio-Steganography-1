# Audio-Steganography
  Steganography does not alter the structure of the secret message, but hides it inside a cover audio so that it cannot be seen. A message in a cipher text, for instance, might arouse suspicion on the part of the recipient while an “invisible” message created with steganographic methods will not. In other word, steganography prevents an unintended recipient from suspecting that the data exists. In addition, the security of classical steganography system relies on secrecy of the data encoding system. Once the encoding system is known, the steganography system is defeated.
